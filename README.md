# Tensor Data Model
## Introduction
TDM is a prototype aiming at expending tensor utilization, by providing a type-safe implementation that is centered around dimensions' values and not around indexes. It is written in Scala with [shapeless](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless).
The model is described in the article [Polystore and Tensor Data Model for Logical Data Independence and Impedance Mismatch in Big Data Analytics](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-60531-8_3), and is a similiar work to [Typesafe Abstractions for Tensor Operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06892) and to [NamedTensor](https://github.com/harvardnlp/NamedTensor).
